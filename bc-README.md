# Bandcamp README

To create a distribution build of j2objc:

* Clone this repo
* Check out the `bc` branch
* Run the following commands:

```
$ ./bc-build.sh
$ ./bc-release.sh
```

The end result is a new release [here](https://github.com/bandcampdotcom/j2objc/releases).

## Other Notes

We should use the "Sync fork" button periodically on the `bc` branch to keep it in sync with Google.
